# Aggregate
### A mediocre RSS Aggregator!

## What Is It?
Well... It's an RSS Aggregator? Basically, it goes out and gets data from sources you choose, and displays it! The data is generally for news, like [this one from the BBC](http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml?edition=uk#) which returns their most recent articles.
The aggregator simply oes out to the world and fetches this data, and presents it in a way that is readable, not some XML jibberjabber like this:
![the BBC feed at the time of writing.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43147625/125088427-4bcf7b80-e0c5-11eb-89bd-05d576477d8c.png)

As you can see, that is not readable. Aggregators, like this one, solve this.

Aggregators also allow the user to access many sources with ease! So, you may want to access your four favourite news feeds in a quick way, but don't have the time to go to their individual sites. An Aggregator solves this issue.

## Why Jason? Isn't RSS dead?
Well, kinda. The timing for RSS was unfrtunate, as the boom of social media meant everybody went to social sites for their news, rather than the official outlets. Also, people are now turning to the news for entertainent, rather than to see current affairs. In a world where you can just "follow" a news vendor, why would you go through the hassle of setting up a whole program dedicated to news?
![This Quora link](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-RSS-Rich-Site-Summary-lose-its-popularity?share=1) goes into detail about some of these points.

## Hassle? Why would I want this if it would just be a hassle to set up?
It isn't, becasue Aggregate was made by me. I'm not a lazy person, i just believe everything should be efficent. That's the point of Aggregate. I have attempted to make it be as efficent as possible, without sacrificing quality.
When complete, using it should be as simple as providing RSS sources. No messing around online sifting through all your news, it will all be in the one place. A place dedicated to *just* news, no social posts from friends or content like 'LOOK AT THESE DOGS DRESSED IN SKIRTS!' or '10 NEW DIETS TO LOSE 100lbs IN TWO HOURS! YOU WON'T BELIEVE NUMBER 3!'

Just News, No Hassle
(did i just make the motto?)
